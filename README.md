# HBC2018

The proposed method for Human Behavior Challenge(HBC) 2018 (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17401)

phases during the process

	"interpolation train.py" and "interpolation test.py" files

		* Each instance was cut at the beginning and at the end to create samples with all cut-off combinations from 1 to 45 seconds.
		* Each sample was repeated in the training set the number of times referring to the size of the cut.
		* A linear interpolation by parts was performed of each sample and 11 equally spaced points were selected to normalize the trajectory size of all samples.
	
	"distance.h" file

		* It was calculated the distance between each point of the interpolated trajectory and each of the objectives
	
	"classifier.py" file
		* The data set generated by these distances was used for supervised learning
		* The training was done with the function GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn with the parameters:
				params = {'n_estimators': 1000, 'max_leaf_nodes': 4, 'max_depth': None, 'random_state': 2,
				'min_samples_split': 5, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'subsample': 0.5}
